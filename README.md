# Windows Color Filter Control

A simple Python app built with Tkinter and [WinMagnification](https://github.com/MaxBQb/WinMagnification) to control the color filter settings on Windows outside of the system settings app. Built for SpartaHack 8.

## Why?

We learned how to interact with the Windows magnification API, which controls color filters, using Python. (Someone else was kind enough to write the Python package; we wrote a GUI for it.)

## What else could we do with this?

This is a super basic demo to acquaint ourselves with the API, but it could be applied outside of this app to enhance accessibility settings for users. For instance, if users want to change color filter settings per app, then a tool with more system integration than we implemented could provide that.
